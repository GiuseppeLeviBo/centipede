# QIX®-STYLE

Arcade territory duel inspired by the classic Qix formula, built as a modern browser game with React, Vite, Canvas, a standalone HTML export, PWA assets, high scores, and cabinet-style attract mode.

## Play

Open `qix-style-standalone.html` directly in a browser. 

Published web version:

- Main game: `https://giuseppelevibo.github.io/QIX_LIKE/`
- Recommended install/open link for the hosted PWA: `https://giuseppelevibo.github.io/QIX_LIKE/qix-style-standalone.html`

The game starts in cabinet attract mode:

- Title screen: about 10 seconds
- Demo autoplay: about 20 seconds
- High scores: about 10 seconds
- Then the loop repeats

## Controls

- `Space`: insert coin
- `R`: start
- Arrow keys or `WASD`: move while held
- `Space` during play: slow draw
- `N`: next level after completing one
- `P`: technical autoplay toggle

Slow draw is slower, colors captured areas red, and awards double capture points. If the marker stops while drawing, a fuse burns along the trail toward the player.

## Features

- Canvas arcade playfield
- Qix-like territory capture
- Sparx edge enemies
- Slow draw and fuse mechanics

- 3-letter high-score table stored in `localStorage`
